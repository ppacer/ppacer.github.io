title: ppacer
---

Ppacer is a DAG scheduler implemented in Go. It aims to provide high
reliability and performance, simple deployments, and minimal resource overhead.


## Motivations

The main motivation behind building ppacer was the pain of using and
maintaining other schedulers implemented in Python, which often involve
challenges related to maintaining Python dependencies and dealing with
relatively low performance and high resource overhead.


## Status

Currently (March 2024) [ppacer core library](https://github.com/ppacer/core) is
close to MVP but far away from even `v0.1`. At the moment I'm focused on
working on the frontend, to deliver MVP version of ppacer.


## Features

* **TODO**
