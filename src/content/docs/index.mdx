Ppacer is a DAG scheduler implemented in Go. It aims to provide high
reliability and performance, simple deployments, and minimal resource overhead.


## Why ppacer?

The goal of ppacer is to introduce a workflow scheduler (and executors) that
is:

* Straightforward to set up locally and deploy to a production environment.
* Reliable, stable and easy to maintain.
* Capable of providing high performance with very low overhead during process
    scheduling and execution.
* Designed with minimal runtime dependencies.
* Simple by default and easy customizable when needed.
* Built to offer a great developer experience.


## Features

Ppacer's high-level features include:

* Compilation into self-contained binaries available on all modern operating
    systems.
* Support for sending external alerts and notifications.
* A core library that has no dependencies other than SQLite driver.
* The ability to implement end-to-end tests for DAG execution as regular Go
    tests.


## Status

Currently (August 2024) [ppacer core library](https://github.com/ppacer/core) is
close to MVP but far away from even `v0.1`. At the moment I'm focused on
working on the frontend, to deliver MVP version of ppacer.
