title: Notifications
---

Notifications in context of ppacer are messages sent externally to ppacer.
Instant example of notification we can think of is an alert message sent when
one of DAG run has failed.

The interface for notification sender is defined in
[ppacer/core/notify](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ppacer/core/notify) package
and looks more or less like the following.


```go
package notify

import (
    "context"
    "io"
)

type Template interface {
    Execute(io.Writer, any) error
}

type Sender interface {
    Send(context.Context, Template, MsgData) error
}

type MsgData struct {
    DagId        string
    ExecTs       string
    TaskId       *string
    TaskRunError error
    RuntimeInfo  map[string]any
}
```

Interface `notify.Sender` has exactly one method `Send` which for given
context, message template and relevant data renders and sends the message.
Message template can be anything which satisfy `notify.Template` interface.
That interface was designed primarily, to support both `text/template`
and `html/template` standard Go packages for templating. Type `notify.MsgData`
contains runtime information about DAG run relevant to the notification we are
about to render and send.

Package `notify` provides also two implementations of `notify.Sender`
interface:

* `notify.LogsErr` - notifications are sent as `slog/log` error messages. This
  is the default set for local development.
* `notify.Mock` - notifications are sent via appending existing `*[]string`.
  This implementations is primarily used for internal ppacer testing.


## Notifications in ppacer

Notification senders in ppacer are used primarily in two places -
`scheduler.TaskScheduler` and `dag.Task.Execute` method implementations via
`dag.TaskContext`.

Scheduler needs to have notifier setup, to automatically send notifications
when a `Task` execution has failed. This action is configurable on `Task` level
via
[TaskConfig.SendAlertOnFailure](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ppacer/core/dag#TaskConfig)
with default value set to `true`. In the same configuration type we have a
field called `AlertOnFailureTemplate` which states what template should be used
to render alert messages. Default alert template is defined using
`text/template` as follows:

```go
func DefaultAlertTemplate() *template.Template {
    body := `
Task [{{.TaskId}}] in DAG [{{.DagId}}] at {{.ExecTs}} has failed.
{{- if .TaskRunError}}
Error:
    {{.TaskRunError.Error}}
{{end}}
`
    return template.Must(template.New("default").Parse(body))
}
```

Even though configuration on sending alerts and its template are set on `Task`
level, notification sender type is set on `scheduler.TaskScheduler` level via
its `Notifier` field of type `notify.Sender`. Default setting for notification
sender is `notify.LogsErr` which sends notifications as log `ERR` messages.
That means ppacer uses single way of sending notifications (for example using
Slack) for all DAGs and tasks. We can override this setup on `Task` level when
we are constructing a DAG, like this:

```go
...
emailNotifier := MyEmailNotifier()
n1 := dag.NewNode(emptyTask{taskId: "start"})
n2 := dag.NewNode(
        errTask{taskId: "task1"},
        dag.WithCustomNotifier(emailNotifier),
    )
n3 := dag.NewNode(emptyTask{taskId: "end"})
n1.Next(n2).Next(n3)

myDag := dag.New(dagId).AddRoot(n1).Done()
```

In the example above tasks `start` and `end` would use default notifier set in
`TaskScheduler`, but task `task1` would use email notifier (it's just an
example, it's not a part of `notify` package at the moment).


The second place where notification senders can be used is `Task.Execute`
method via `TaskContext`. It enables sending external notifications based on
task's internal logic. For example task could query a database, read some
statistic and based on its value send alert message.

Task are executed by `exec.Executor`. Similarly to scheduler, we setup single
instance of notification sender in `exec.Executor` constructor and it will be
used for all `TaskContext` unless given task used `WithCustomNotifier`, to
update the configuration, the same way as described earlier. Using notifier
from inside `Task.Execute` method is simple as regular function call:

```go
func (t *MyTask) Execute(tc dag.TaskContext) error {
    if rand.Intn(10) > 7 {
        ctx := context.TODO()
        tmplBody := "Sending a ping: {{.ExecTs}}"
        tmpl := template.Must(template.New("msg").Parse(tmplBody))
        msgData := notify.MsgData{ExecTs: tc.DagRun.ExecTs}
        sendErr := tc.Notifier.Send(ctx, tmpl, msgData)
        if sendErr != nil {
            tc.Logger.Error("Failure while sending external message",
                "err", sendErr.Error())
            return sendErr
        }
    }
    return nil
}

```

In the example above we can see a `Task` implementation which sends an external
message in case when randomly generated number is greater than seven.


## Notifier implementations

Up to this point we learned about the generic interface for sending
notifications and its implementations within `ppacer/core/notify` package.
Those implementations are primarily useful for local development and writing
tests. More practical implementations are available in
[github.com/ppacer/notifiers](https://github.com/ppacer/notifiers) project.


Project `ppacer/notifiers` has the following structure:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- .git
- README.md
- discord
    - go.mod
    - go.sum
    - discord.go
- telegram
    - go.mod
    - go.sum
    - telegram.go
- ...
</FileTree>

As we can see, the `ppacer/notifiers` project contains multiple Go packages.
Each Go package provides at least one implementation of
`ppacer/core/notify.Sender` for a specific communication channel. Different
communication channels are divided into separate Go packages, because they
might require different sets of dependencies, and typically only one
communication channel is used for the scheduler. Fetching all other
dependencies for other notifiers would be suboptimal. That is also why we
avoided adding communication-channel-specific implementations to the ppacer
core notification package.
